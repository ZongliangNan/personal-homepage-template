### **Research Interests**   

During the doctoral studies, I was mainly engaged in the overall design and development of software projects for 3D imaging LiDAR control systems, including module and equipment selection, system design, overall control system program development, and visual point cloud software development. Additionally, I developed obstacle recognition algorithms with different precision levels to meet the project requirements of different scenarios (such as railways, highways, etc.), and gained an in-depth understanding of the algorithm principles and applicable conditions.
